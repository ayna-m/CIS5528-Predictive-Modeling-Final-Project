notes for ML_SF.py

All data files retrieved from cBioPortal (https://www.cbioportal.org/study/summary?id=brca_metabric) (downloaded tar.gz file of all clinical and genomic data). Extracted files for CNA, RNA-seq, and clinical data for project.
(It doesn't let me upload the data_cna.xlsx file bc of the size)

PROCESS::
Downloaded full METABRIC dataset file with clinical and genomic data. 

Some file data:

  cancer_study_identifier: brca_metabric
  genetic_alteration_type: MRNA_EXPRESSION
  datatype: Z-SCORE
  stable_id: mrna_median_all_sample_Zscores
  show_profile_in_analysis_tab: true
  profile_description: Log-transformed mRNA z-Scores compared to the expression distribution of all samples (Illumina HT-12 v3 microarray)
  profile_name: mRNA expression z-scores relative to all samples (log microarray)
  data_filename: data_mrna_illumina_microarray_zscores_ref_diploid_samples.txt
//
  cancer_study_identifier: brca_metabric
  genetic_alteration_type: COPY_NUMBER_ALTERATION
  datatype: DISCRETE
  stable_id: cna
  show_profile_in_analysis_tab: true
  profile_description: Copy-number alterations from DNA copy. Calls made after normal contamination correction and CNV removal using thresholds. Values: -2 = homozygous deletion; -1 = hemizygous deletion; 0 = neutral / no change; 1 = gain; 2 = high level amplification.
  profile_name: Putative copy-number alterations from DNAcopy.
  data_filename: data_cna.txt

Files to use: data_cna.xlsx, data_mutations.xlsx, brca_metabric_clinical_data.xlsx

Clinical data: reading in the 4 columns of interest (sampleID, vital status, mutations count)
RNA data: reading in sampleID and mutation columns + merging with clinical data by sampleID
CNA data: ??
Combined into one dataframe
Made a list of sampleIDs from the clinical data readin
Filtered out samples that were blank in vital status column

The whole beginning portion of the code (setting up model) is based on the code here and adjusted for the data. (https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/basics/quickstart_tutorial.html)

Assigned the first 80% of the samples to train the model + assigned the end 20% for testing

QUESTION - Should the data remain divided so we can do individual CNN models for each and combine them? Or we can do a clinical and RNA-seq combination with a CNA separate model since that dataset format is more complex. We can focus on the clinical and RNA-seq for the midterm report + factor in CNA later then??
